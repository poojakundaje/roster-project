Roster Project: 
The roster is kept in alphabetical order and once the roster reaches the maximum size determined by the user, any additional students are added to the waitlist. If the roster was full but then drops below the specified maximum size because of a removal, and there are students on the wait list, then the first student on the wait list moves to the roster and is placed in the correct alphabetic order. 
Tested the doublylinkedlist class methods.
